# [users]
# admin = password, root
#
# [roles]
# root = *:*

[urls]
# All urls omitted will be available by anonymous users (RBAC disabled).
# You need to enable auth at least for the security endpoint though, otherwise
# Shiro won't try to look up the username/password (so, it won't be able
# to return the correct permissions).
