# Bypass the servlet container completely for session management and delegate
# it to Shiro (to be portable across servlet containers)
# The default session timeout is 30 minutes.
sessionManager = org.apache.shiro.web.session.mgt.DefaultWebSessionManager
# Use the configured native session manager
securityManager.sessionManager = $sessionManager

# Example on how to define an admin user
#
# [users]
# admin = password, root
#
# [roles]
# root = *:*

[urls]
# All urls omitted will be available by anonymous users (RBAC disabled).
# You need to enable auth at least for the security endpoint though, otherwise
# Shiro won't try to look up the username/password (so, it won't be able
# to return the correct permissions).
